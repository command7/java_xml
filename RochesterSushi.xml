                <LastReviewIntro> No curb appeal, but what an interior! Fun Japanese pop music. Sweet, amiable staff. Not the cheapest sushi experience Ive had, but the food and service were top notch.</LastReviewIntro>

                <LastReviewIntro> the best restaurant in Rochester: I have been here a couple of times now, and have been more impressed each time. Went there with friends, and with my mom. superb service, and you cant get much better food. The servers wont let your glass get empty, and dont hurry you out at all. Wonderful place to eat dinner.</LastReviewIntro>

                <LastReviewIntro> 1) Service was lousy. -25 minutes to get a drink -Asked for silverware when appetizers were delivered. After they delivered salad I got up and got my own. -Had to ask for water multiple times2) All the food for our end of the table was totally over cooked.3) Extras were not offered to our end of the table. 3 times it was offered to the same people at the other end of the table. They left with more left overs than I received for my total meal. I LEFT HUNGRY.4) Forgot to bring one of the appetizers and had to ask again for it. They finally brought it out at the end of the meal5) Chefs skill was questionable. Portions not equal. Some food was burnt. Steak was way over cooked and chewy low grade of meat.6) Only one chef for four tables and had to wait a long time.Bottom line wont eat there again.</LastReviewIntro>

                <LastReviewIntro> I have eaten at many a Japanese steakhouse in several states. This is not only the worst; multiple things about it were the worst. Wine from absolute hell (undrinkable). Soggy fried rice (hard to completely ruin rice in the microwave age, but they managed; it was soggy before it hit the grill). Bad broccoli. Bad, tasteless sauce--both of them. So bad, in fact, that although I never have been motivated to complain about a restaurant online before, this one motivated me to do so multiple times. Unimaginable why it s packed and popular. Customers must be hard up for entertainment and ignore food for the performance.</LastReviewIntro>

                <LastReviewIntro> I went with my two girls last week and was told it would be around 1-1/2 wait so we had our name put on list hoping we would get seated sooner. It was busy because the groupons were expiring (which they knew ahead of time, so one would think they would be prepared). Well needless to say after 1-1/2 we still were not seated and there were several tables available. I asked how much longer and the hostess said another hour. I told her we have already been waiting for 1 hour she smirked and said sorry. People were coming in after us and being seated which made one of my girls ask the question why do they get a table before us. I went back in and said since my kids are tired is there anyway I could order take out and use my groupon since I am here and of course the hostess replied no its for dine in only. Ugh we left and ate elsewhere. I did call to speak with the manager who really was more concerned about telling me how proud she was of her staff and really didnt seem to care about our awful experience. Too bad because they lost several customers that night. What ever happend to customer service?</LastReviewIntro>
